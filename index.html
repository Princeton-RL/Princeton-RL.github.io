**Princeton Reinforcement Learning (RL) Lab**

Welcome! The Princeton RL lab aims to develop effective and principled reinforcement learning algorithms.
This includes studying/analyzing existing methods, building new methods, applying methods to new applications, and understanding what happens when you scale up these methods.
Currently, there is a focus on understanding _unsupervised_ / _self-supervised_ methods, including methods that can propose their own goals and autonomously collect data.

Code for our projects is available at [https://github.com/Princeton-RL](https://github.com/Princeton-RL).
